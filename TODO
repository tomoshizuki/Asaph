- The 404 pages needs a separate rewrite since atm the .htaccess rewrites every failed request to /.
  - Done. 404's are working now but there's no need for an additional rewrite. PHP can handle this on it's own.
- Use <!DOCTYPE html>.
- Make everything SSL-ready.
- Use height and width in <img>-tags.
- Better use some salty nice hashes for the passwords instead of the old-fashioned md5.
